## Executive Summary

This project aims to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, the project identifies key factors influencing customer churn and provides actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

### Problem Statement
How can we develop a predictive model to identify the most effective factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry, and what are the key drivers of customer retention?

### Rationale
Customer churn is a significant challenge for telecom companies. Understanding why customers leave enables businesses to take proactive measures to retain them, thereby reducing costs and improving profitability.

---

## Research Questions
1. What are the primary factors that influence customer churn in the telecom industry?
2. How can predictive models identify customers at risk of churning?
3. What actionable insights can be derived to enhance customer retention?

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage patterns, billing information, and contract details. The target variable is `Churn`, which indicates whether a customer has left the service.

### Key Features:
- **Demographics**: Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents
- **Service Usage**: Internet Service, Streaming TV/Movies, Tech Support
- **Billing Information**: Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Payment Method
- **Contract Details**: Tenure, Contract Type, Paperless Billing

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Addressed missing values and removed duplicates.
- Conducted outlier analysis and feature engineering.
- Visualized relationships between variables using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Modeling
- Supervised Learning Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests
  - XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

## Results
Key findings include:
1. Customers with month-to-month contracts and higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
2. Tenure is inversely related to churnâ€”longer-tenured customers are less likely to leave.
3. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among tested models.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the best-performing model for real-time churn prediction.
2. Develop a dashboard for visualizing churn trends.
3. Conduct A/B testing to validate retention strategies.
